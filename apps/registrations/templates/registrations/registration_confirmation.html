    Note that admissions from the waiting list are ordered by registration
    date, but will only consider registrations that have been paid for. In
    other words, make sure to pay for your registration as soon as possible,
    otherwise it will not be considered if a spot frees up. If you
    cancel your waitinglist registration, or no spot frees up before the
    event, you will of course get a full refund.
