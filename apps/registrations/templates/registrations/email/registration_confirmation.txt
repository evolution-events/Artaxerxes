Your registration for {{event}} was completed. You are not admitted yet,
see the event website for details on how and when you will be admitted:
{{eventurl}}).
  {% endblocktrans %}
  {% endif %}
{% elif registration.status.REGISTERED %}
{% blocktrans with event=registration.event eventurl=registration.event.display_url %}
Your registration for {{event}} was completed. Your spot is secured for
you, provided that you pay in time (see the event website for the
payment policy: {{eventurl}}).
{% endblocktrans %}
{% else %}
{% blocktrans with event=registration.event %}
Your registration for {{event}} was completed. However, your
registration was put on the waitinglist because the event (or one of the
options you selected) is full.
{% endblocktrans %}
.
{% blocktrans %}
Note that admissions from the waiting list are ordered by registration
date. You can see your waiting list position on the dashboard. Normally,
we only consider registrations that have been paid for, but for On the
Styx we have made an exception to this rule (see the event website). So
no payment is needed now, only when you are actually admitted to the
event.
