<h2>{% trans 'What is it?' %}</h2>
<p>
  {% blocktrans trimmed %}
  This is the registration system for events by Evolution Events. After signing in you will find
  an overview of our events that you can register for, if there are any in the future. By registering
  for an event you reserve a spot at the event and agree to follow our rules concerning payment,
  cancelling and participation. More information about this can be found at the 'practical information' page
  (after signing in).
  {% endblocktrans %}

<h2>{% trans 'Account in this system' %}</h2>
<p>
  {% blocktrans trimmed %}
  Everybody who wants to use this registration system has to create a new account ('sign up'). Even if in the old
  system (from before 2020, linked to our forums) you had an account, you need to make a new one here. You can use
  the same email address. This makes it possible for us to (sometime in the future) import some history from the old
  system to this new one. However, you can also use a different email address. Later you can always add more secundary
  addresses to the same account if you want to. The primary email address will be used to contact you, the other
  address(es) can (also) be used for signing in and password recovery. If one of your secundary addresses has been used in
  the old registration system we can use that for later transferring some history as well.

<h2>{% trans '(Prepare) registration for event' %}</h2>
<p>
  {% blocktrans trimmed %}
  Both at the event website and in this system a date and time will be shown when registration for the
  event will open. If you want to be really quick at registering you can <em>prepare your registration</em>.
  This means that you can fill in all necessary information and make the choices for the event (like type
  of registration, additional options) before registration is actually opened. Then when the registration
  does open, all you have to do is agree to the conditions (which you can read beforehand) and press 'register'.
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>
<p>
  {% blocktrans trimmed %}
  If registration is already opened you can no longer <em>prepare</em> your registration but you will be
  able to register in one go, entering the same information that would be required on preparation. Until
  registration time closes (which might be right up to the event itself) you will be able to register, even
  if the event is already full. If the event is full when you register you will be put on the waiting list
  for the event. When a particpant cancels and you are the next in line on the waiting list we will contact
  you to check if you still want to participate. Specific rules about the waiting list and the order in
  which waiting list registrations are processed can be read in our house rules or, if it differs, at
  the event specific website.
