Dear {{user.get_full_name}},
.
{% if registration.status.REGISTERED %}
{% blocktrans with event=registration.event eventurl=registration.event.display_url %}
Your registration for {{event}} was completed. Your spot is secured for
you, provided that you pay in time (see the event website for the
payment policy: {{eventurl}}).
{% endblocktrans %}
{% else %}
{% blocktrans with event=registration.event %}
Your registration for {{event}} was completed. However, your
registration was put on the waitinglist because the event (or one of the
options you selected) is full.
{% endblocktrans %}
.
{% blocktrans %}
Note that admissions from the waiting list are ordered by registration
date, but will only consider registrations that have been paid for. In
other words, make sure to pay for your registration as soon as possible,
otherwise it will not be considered if a spot frees up. If you
cancel your waitinglist registration, or no spot frees up before the
event, you will of course get a full refund.
