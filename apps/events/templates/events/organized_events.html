                <p>Here you will find details about the admitted
                registrations (so excluding e.g. the waitinglist or
                cancelled registrations), in different forms intended
                for specific purposes. This information should be shared
                carefully and only within organizers and crew (see the
                <a href="{{ privacy_url }}">privacy policy</a> for
                details).</p>

                <h3>Registration forms</h3>
                <p>These are registration forms and are intended to be printed and signed by participants during participant check-in.</p>

                <h3>Safety info</h3>
                <p>This page shows any safety-related information
                (except emergency contacts) provided by participants. It
                contains potentially extra sensitive (medical) details,
                so it is intended to be reviewed by the safety
                coordinator (and/or other organizers), with only
                selected information to be shared among organizers and
                crew members only if needed. If sharing this information with
                (selected) other participants (e.g. first aiders) seems
                important, explicit consent must be obtained first.</p>

                <h3>Safety info â€” printable reference</h3>
                <p>This document collects the safety information about
                each participant (including emergency contacts), to
                print and reference during the event.  This contains
                potentially extra sensitive (medical) details so should
                only be accessed for printing shortly before the event,
                stored securely during the event and properly destroyed
                immediately afterwards.</p>
                <p>There should not normally be any reason to look at
                this document unless an emergency occurs.</p>
